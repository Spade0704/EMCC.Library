> Historical sprints rolled out of `tasks/todo.md` once their work is complete. Newest at top.

## Archived 2026-07-03 (shipped-but-open moved from todo.md; EOD housekeeping reconcile)

All six items below were still parked `[x]` in `todo.md` ("for-review" / "merge-pending") after their PRs had in fact merged to `main` and the branches were deleted (remote has zero non-main branches, verified `git ls-remote`). Rolled with merge evidence.

### Codex-engine backlog
- [x] **M001 tier-aware `check_concept_coverage.py`** — **MERGED #61 (`03dd6e2`)**, branch `m001-tier-aware-coverage` deleted. `tier_filter` gating default OFF; Lattice build `9e5b65d`; dual-PASS chain (decorrelated delta-force → executes-clean 867/867 → Regime-B Auditor PASS → Grok /cross-check PASS; audits `tasks/audits/2026-06-27-library-m001-*`). Full history in the 2026-06-27 session entry. Mentor pickup via Sync remains tracked under "Cross-repo (Mentor-side)".
- [x] **`./Folder/Page` page-relative resolver flip** + **distinct "escapes wiki root" dashboard message** — **MERGED #52 (`f8666f3`)**, branch `claude/codex-link-resolver` deleted. Portfolio-wide `[[./` grep = zero real links, flip changes no current output; `(page, status)` resolver + pattern-#5 literal w/ paired tests; +11 tests.
- [x] **YAML block-list parser→validator seam regression test** — **MERGED #50 (`ff5a243`)**, branch `claude/codex-yaml-block-list-fix` deleted. Parser itself was fixed earlier (`cf9a834`, merged `fe5ddcb`); #50 locks the seam (block-list canon honored at ready; empty block flagged). +2 tests. Ready-gate filter confirmed working-as-designed, not widened.

### Readiness cascade tails
- [x] **lib-wiki link-graph-integrity layer** — **MERGED #52 (`f8666f3`)**. `check_link_graph.py` (unreachable_pages + dead_end_pages, SSOT reuse of the cross-refs resolver, `allow_orphan` honored). +22 tests.

### Codex v1.3.1 cross-link tails
- [x] **Topic-index plugin hook wired end-to-end** + **dotted-code section-topic derivation in `backfill_topics.py`** — **MERGED #51 (`3591c0e`)**, branch `claude/codex-topic-pipeline` deleted. Both opt-in / byte-identical when unconfigured; Aviation can retire its local forks. +19 tests.
- [x] **Full dry-Sync zero-diff check to DFDU — VERIFIED PASS (2026-06-19, Director cascade).** Verification record (no code): live `sync_from_kit.py --dry-run` from DFDU root exit 0, 5 OVERWRITE / 1 MERGE-NEW / 35 SKIP, zero behavioral diff confirmed via no-opt-in grep + default-config proxy + code-gate read. Mentor-side dry-Sync remains open (tracked under "Cross-repo (Mentor-side)").

### Cairn/Gateway accuracy track
- [x] **Tiered caution-index** — **MERGED #53 (`02dd5d3`)**, branch `claude/codex-tiered-caution-index` deleted. `build_caution_index.py` (script #19): deterministic two-tier router (surfaced verbatim-caution vs escalate/fail-closed), no neural picker in the caution path, ambiguity-refuse proven by tests; report-only in `update_dashboards.py` (priority 22), `--enforce` opt-in; spec §"Accuracy contract" amended. +20 tests. The gated lossless effectivity-normalization sibling stays OPEN in todo.md (funding decision, not auto-build).

### Operator / consumer-side carry
- [x] **DONE (merged #59, 2026-06-21) — Library `CLAUDE.md` framework/22 coding-workflow block added.** Library was flagged as a missing-block consumer by the EMCC P1 deprecation report. Added via the Unit-1-fixed generator `patch_consumer_workflow.py` (EMCC e8467a9/#239): cert-handoff/v1.1, marker `framework22 v2`, referenced-not-vendored (one-line route to `EMCC/framework/22-coding-workflow.md`). Full Lattice gate: executes-clean PASS → independent Auditor (Regime B) PASS → `validate_cert_handoff.py` PASS → Grok cert-handoff dropped+pushed → Director dual-PASS close + merge #59. Branch `claude/add-framework22-block` GC'd. **Prior flag RESOLVED (2026-06-25):** the on-main Grok cert evidence is now committed — `tasks/audits/2026-06-21-library-framework22-block-grok-cert.md` (`auditor_verdict: PASS` / `verdict: PASS`, `c80aa77`) + inbox copy archived (`ca396c3`); the earlier "handoff `status: pending` + no committed grok-cert file" gap is closed. SoT: EMCC `wiki.EMCC/git/Coding-Workflow.md` + `framework/22`.

## Archived 2026-06-16 (done/stale moved from todo.md)

### Codex-engine backlog
- [x] **🔴 Normalize a leading `../` in cross-ref wikilinks portfolio-wide.** (DONE 2026-06-14, dir-20260614-lib-relpath-resolver.) `check_cross_refs._resolve_target` now resolves page-relative `[[../folder/Page]]` against the linking page's own folder via `posixpath.normpath` (pure-string, no FS touch); escapes-root → broken. Decision = **page-relative** (not redundant-to-root): council-unanimous — strip-to-root rots silently at tree depth ≥2 and resolves genuine escapes. Bare-stem / `Folder/Page` / `./` frozen unchanged (scope = `..` only). Gate `tasks/delta-force/delta-force-20260614-155733.md` (DFTS hard-trigger). +10 tests (761→771). Auditor Regime B + human-at-merge.

### Sprint — Readiness cascade dir-ii/hh/jj (DONE 2026-06-14b; all merged)
Gate `tasks/delta-force/delta-force-20260614-092532.md`; Auditor Regime B PASS. Scores reconciled live.
- [x] **lib-codex 90→92** — report-only `audit_citations` wired into the orchestrator (failure-isolated, no health-section, own dashboard) + tests. PR #48.
- [x] **lib-librarian — CAPPED 85** — honest cap (Cross-Project-Scan blocked on EMCC orchestrator; at-scale curation needs live LLM runtime).
- [x] **mentor-wiki 75→77** — surgical orphan link (PR #17).
- [x] **dfdu-wiki 22→48** — Project-Overview + Glossary (18 terms) + orphan link (PR-merged).
- [x] **iso-wiki 20→38** — orphan link (PR #42).
- [x] **emcc-wiki 25→50** — patch handed to Director, applied on EMCC main (300ab02/2b85c0b); `tasks/patches/emcc-wiki-fill-dir-jj.md`.
- [x] **Inbox-Triage.md (EMCC tree)** — 1-line inline-conversion patch handed to Director (block-list `canon_sources` → inline; same sources).

### Sprint — Readiness cascade dir-20260614n (BUILT 2026-06-14; MERGED via PR #47)
Director cascade `dir-20260614n-readiness-library` (req `96acbc3a`). Gate `tasks/delta-force/delta-force-20260614-061339.md` (DFTS=8). Auditor Regime B: PASS. Branch `claude/readiness-lib-wiki-summary-op-20260614` @ `583fab3`.
- [x] **lib-wiki 45→70** — self-wiki validators 50 broken + 13 orphans → 0/0: P9 full-path cross-ref resolution (+dup-stem guard), list-aware indented-code strip (clears verbatim-doc false-positives without editing), populated Glossary (16 terms), Home protocol-canon links, CODEX_LIBRARIAN canon_sources. +9 tests.
- [x] **lib-summary-op 55→68** — canonical `_scripts/summarize.py` (extractive default + injectable LLM seam, honestly named, faithfulness guarantee). +16 tests.
- [x] **Cleanup: 2 pre-existing `test_sync_from_kit` TestSyncStamp failures** — STALE; root cause fixed (3c3fcdc / cf9a834). Windows CRLF/git-state churn (NOT from this work); confirmed on clean tree.

### Sprint — Codex v1.3.1 cross-link at scale (BUILT 2026-06-13b)
Surfaced by the Aviation consumer; plan `0-Inbox/_archive/PLAN-cross-link-promotion-2026-06-13.md` (archived 2026-06-15, dir-20260615). Opt-in defaults = v1.3 byte-identical. Committed `4dce454`. Independent Auditor: SHIP-WITH-FIXES (fixes applied).
- [x] **P18.3 See-also cap + ranking** — `see_also.max_links_per_page` (0=uncapped) wired into `cross_link_topics.py` with shared-topic/cross-container/path ranking. Fixes the dead `max_links` config. (aca5986)
- [x] **Duplicate-stem disambiguation** — `see_also.disambiguate_duplicate_stems` → path-qualified links on wiki-wide stem collision; spec §2.7 amended.
- [x] **`backfill_topics.py`** — generic bulk topic tagger (path + keyword) for retrofitting pre-existing wikis; inline+block-list `topics:` safe (additive). Template config shipped. +tests (suite 690→720).
- [x] **`CODEX_LIBRARIAN.md` v1.3.1 op** (two-linker distinction, cap, dup-stem, granularity, backfill) + regenerated drop-in. Plugin marked EXPERIMENTAL/not-wired in spec + config.

### Sprint — boilerplate-location convention (RATIFIED + BUILT 2026-06-11)
- [x] **Operator ratified** `tasks/plans/boilerplate-location-spec-proposal.md` (§2 split + §3 Option A) — 2026-06-11.
- [x] **Built** under the gate `EMCC.DFDU/tasks/delta-force/2026-06-11-boilerplate-stub-build.md` (PR #45): 4 protocol templates -> stubs (canonical pointer + summary; frontmatter parity); `demote_boilerplate_stubs.py` one-off (body-only guard, git-history baseline at pinned `08d87ac`, structural codex exclusion, dry-run); spec amendment in `PROJECT_WIKI_BUILD_SPEC.md` §"Boilerplate location"; canonical-copy notes on the 4 `wiki.codex` pages; `materialize_boilerplate.py` docstring. Suite 666 -> 678 (6 skipped). Migration run across the wave consumers EMCC-side.

### Sprint — M-A structural Sync build, Library half (CLOSED 2026-06-11 — ALL components shipped + merged)
Gate: `EMCC.DFDU/tasks/delta-force/2026-06-10-ma-structural-sync.md`. Branch `claude/emcc-ma-build-p7ohln`. Session record: `tasks/sessions.md` 2026-06-10b + EMCC `tasks/sessions.md` 2026-06-10g.
- [x] **Component 1 — dead-regex example fix** (`da16ecf`): single-backslash examples in `_config/forbidden_terms.yaml` + `reveal_leak_patterns.yaml`; convention in `_config/README.md` + `PROJECT_WIKI_BUILD_SPEC.md` §2.5; negative-control tests welded to the shipped examples. Auditor PASS.
- [x] **Component 2 — SYNC-STAMP.json** (`260d6c7` + `9f3ff95`): `_write_stamp` dedicated final action; the stamp IS the manifest; all-OK only, never on `--dry-run`; dirty-kit WARN (audit fix). Auditor concerns→fixed.
- [x] **Component 4 docs** (`66a8e22`): `wiki.codex/git/codex/SYNC_STAMP_CONTRACT.md` canon + MI-20 (closes MI-19's version-staleness follow-up) + Index rows. Suite 644→655 (6 skipped). EMCC-side halves: `check_drift.py` + `emcc_wire._copy_librarian` (Lock 1).
- [x] **Component 5 — CARTO-06 materialize-then-link** (PR #42, merged 2026-06-11): `materialize_boilerplate.py` + bootstrap carve-out + canon note; Auditor concerns fixed (`d33921c`). Suite 666.
- [x] **Component 6 — consumer refresh wave** (2026-06-11, all 11 merged incl. tat/isommelier on explicit operator authorization): stamped kit `019168f` + materialize everywhere; first SYNC-STAMP.json portfolio-wide; check_drift verified + surfaced PERSONA-DRIFT follow-ups (emcc_wire re-cascade, EMCC-side).

### Inbound handoff — Cairn/Gateway reframe (2026-06-06): verbatim-only policy
- [x] **Verbatim-only / cite-always / correct-refusal** formalized as Codex canon. *(BUILT 2026-06-13 d2c7667, /delta-force REVISE-AND-PROCEED → standalone audit, canon-first: contract locked in `Frontmatter-Schema.md` §"Accuracy fields" + `PROJECT_WIKI_BUILD_SPEC.md` §"Accuracy contract" (`consequence`/`cite_anchor`, fail-safe HIGH, HIGH⇒non-empty cite_anchor, "Presence-Not-Accuracy" caveat); the existing tested-but-unwired `doc_lint.check_consequence` wired into a new report-only `_scripts/audit_citations.py` (`--enforce` opt-in; standalone so it can't red-bar the full-tree gate). +11 tests green. NOTE: keeps the lint to citation-PRESENCE — it does NOT verify verbatim-ness/refusal-correctness.)*

### Pre-S006 Aviation-prep — Done items (2026-05-28 → 2026-06-03)
- [x] **Orchestrator participation: Librarian cross-session addendum** (Session 11, 2026-06-03): `.claude/modules/claude-orchestrator.md` (Librarian-side cascade rules) + `CLAUDE.md` Development-discipline pointer. Branch `claude/lattice-cross-persona-messaging-ekVx8`. Canon: `spade0704/EMCC` → `framework/09-orchestrator-cross-session.md`.
- [x] **Codex canon: wiki updated every build session** (Session 10, 2026-06-02): Design Principle #14 + §7 Phase-4 requirement in `CODEX_BUILD_SPEC_v1_3.md` + `PROJECT_WIKI_BUILD_SPEC.md`; "Wiki Maintenance Behavior" section in the `CLAUDE_CONTEXT_RULES` template + "Per build session" in the `Update-Cascade` template. 631 tests still pass. (branch `claude/codex-wiki-per-session`).
- [x] Closed stale MI-17 carried entry (commit `109d42e`, branch `claude/gallant-bohr-ePBuX`).
- [x] **Per-project reorganization manifest convention** (v1.3 addendum, 2026-05-28):
  - `REORGANIZATION-INSTRUCTIONS.md` trimmed to master (patterns P1–P8 + audit hooks + cross-repo per-project index)
  - `reorganization-instructions.library.md` created at Library root with Session 1 + S002 + S003b moves
  - Mentor section extracted to `tasks/plans/cross-repo-pending/reorganization-instructions.mentor.md` pending cross-repo move on next Mentor session
  - Aviation seed staged at `tasks/plans/aviation-bootstrap-seed/reorganization-instructions.aviation.md`
  - `bootstrap.py::_stub_reorganization_md` added; emits stub at root for --full / --code / --website modes (omitted in --minimal)
  - 2 new tests in `tests/test_bootstrap_canonical.py`; 606 tests still passing
  - Spec amended: `CODEX_BUILD_SPEC_v1_3.md` (v1.3 addendum + §4.2 NEVER-touched list), `tasks/plans/portfolio-folder-structure-spec.md` (canonical tree + variance allowance + per-folder purpose)
  - `CLAUDE.md` + `Index.md` updated to reference the master/per-project pair

### Reusable patterns — lifted from tat_app (2026-05-30, PR #21 MERGED)
- [x] Authored 6 pattern pages + index in `patterns/`: Decision-Scoring, Opportunistic-Bundling, Offline-First-Sync, Soft-Delete-Signal-Preservation, AI-Memory-And-Insight-Extraction, Neurodivergent-First-UX. Frontmatter validated with the `_lib` parser; dogfood wiki byte-unchanged. (PR #21, squash `44d716e`)
- [x] Mentor cross-repo move complete — manifest moved into Project-Mentor (commit `7ed7f30`, branch `claude/gallant-bohr-ePBuX`); Library staging copy deleted; master index flipped Mentor → Migrated.

### Past sprint — Post-S004 carry closure (2026-05-28, CLOSED)
Closed four post-S004 carried items in one maintenance sprint. 630 tests pass (+25 from S004's 605 baseline).
- [x] **MI-17 full closure** + **dashboard relocation** (coupled) — added `_lib/frontmatter.py::find_wiki_content_root()`; switched all 17 dashboard/validator scripts off the install-root `find_wiki_root()` so dashboards now land at `wiki.codex/git/_dashboards/` (gitignored) instead of leaking to repo-root `_dashboards/`, and page-walks scan only the content side. Added `_lib/cli.py::resolve_cli_wiki_root()` + a `--wiki-root` override (or bare positional) in every standalone P-script `__main__`. MI-17 marked RESOLVED in `MIGRATION-ISSUES.md`. (+10 tests)
- [x] **OBS-4** — `.claude/personas/CLAUDE.librarian.md` is now GENERATED from the canonical `wiki.codex/git/codex/CODEX_LIBRARIAN.md` via `generate_persona_dropin.py` (deterministic; `last_updated` sourced from canonical). `tests/test_persona_dropin.py` fails CI on drift. Drift is now structurally impossible. (+8 tests)
- [x] **OBS-1** — `audit_doc_pairing.py --stale-paths`: AC12 stale-path sweep with an explicit allow-list (`_config/stale_paths.yaml`); replaces the under-counting manual `git grep`. Repo-guard test asserts 0 un-allowlisted hits. (+7 tests)

### Past sprint — S004-mentor-v1.1-migration (2026-05-28, CLOSED)
Cross-repo sprint with `spade0704/Project-Mentor`. Mentor migrated v1.0 → v1.1 canonical layout; Library shipped MI-16 + MI-18 closures + walker fix + manifest update.
- [x] Phase A — open Session 4 + bank architect plan §S004 + Mentor pre-migration anchor SHA
- [x] Phase C — `sync_from_kit.py` v1.1 contract rewrite (MI-16 closure); consumer-name auto-discovery; 17 tests pass + 4 new TestConsumerDiscovery cases; spec doc §4.2 updated
- [x] Phase D — MI-18 canon-lookup marker-walk: `_lib/frontmatter.py::find_canon_dir` + `find_decisions_dir` + extended `_find_wiki_root` with v1.1 consumer marker; 12 scripts retrofitted; 9 new tests; MI-18 registered + RESOLVED
- [x] Phase E — end-to-end validation + carry fixes: `find_config_dir` extension (7 more scripts retrofitted), `markdown.py::iter_content_pages` raw/ exclusion, `update_dashboards.py` CLI arg (MI-17 partial), REORGANIZATION-INSTRUCTIONS Mentor per-project moves + cross-repo Library moves section
- [x] Phase F — Auditor dispatch verdict `concerns` (5 findings); F10 MI-16 registry header RESOLVED-disposition fixed inline; F11 + F12 fixed cross-repo on Mentor side
- [x] S004 CLOSE record on `tasks/sessions.md`
- Cross-repo commits (Mentor side, branch `claude/s004-mentor-v1.1-migration-na3hg`): 12 commits — Phase A (`caafc8a`) + B1-B10 (`a966d27` → `f8e919a`) + close (`42dd4fc`) + F4 (`4e985bc`) + CLOSE record (`867c03b`). Mentor at v1.1 canonical layout post-S004; baseline parity vs M001 verified (27 pages / 0 contradictions / 54% cross-link).
- Migration issues resolved: **MI-16** RESOLVED (sync_from_kit v1.1 contract rewrite); **MI-18** RESOLVED (canon/decisions/config-lookup marker-walk).

### Carried + Open (post-S004) — resolved items
- [x] **MI-17 full closure** — RESOLVED (Post-S004 carry-closure sprint). `find_wiki_content_root()` + per-script `--wiki-root` CLI via `_lib/cli.py`. See `MIGRATION-ISSUES.md` MI-17.
- [x] **OBS-1** — RESOLVED. `audit_doc_pairing.py --stale-paths` + `_config/stale_paths.yaml` allow-list.
- [x] **OBS-4** — RESOLVED. `.claude/personas/CLAUDE.librarian.md` generated from canonical via `generate_persona_dropin.py`; drift guard in `tests/test_persona_dropin.py`.
- [x] **Library `_dashboards/` location** — RESOLVED (coupled with MI-17). Content dashboards now write to `wiki.codex/git/_dashboards/` (was leaking to repo-root `_dashboards/`). NOTE: the S002 audit scripts (`audit_doc_pairing`/`audit_local_split`/etc.) still write to system-side `wikisys.library/_dashboards/` by design — that path is NOT stale.
- [x] **MI-12** (historical curation, S001 carry) — **DROPPED (2026-05-28, operator decision).** `project-codex` is being deprecated, so its historical `tasks/*` + `CHANGELOG.md` no longer need curating/migrating. Won't-do.
- [x] **portfolio-folder-structure-spec.md greenfield claim** — RESOLVED. §883 "Mentor was greenfield, no migration needed" corrected to reflect the S004 v1.0→v1.1 migration.

### Past sprint — Post-S002 stabilization (2026-05-27, CLOSED) — PR #5 → #10

- [x] PR #11 — Post-MI-17 housekeeping: tasks/{sessions,todo,lessons}.md updated (`bf36e9d`)
- MIs touched this arc: **MI-17** Resolved (PR #10) — marker-walk pattern lifted into `_lib/frontmatter.py::find_wiki_root()` public API; 17 scripts converted. **MI-18** Surfaced (post-PR-#10), Resolved in S004 D.

- [x] B9 module.json v1.1.0 + README + CLAUDE.md Path-migrations pointer + MI-10/11/12/13 dispositions
- [x] B10 Auditor dispatch — verdict `pass` with 4 info observations (OBS-2/OBS-3 fixed inline; OBS-1/OBS-4 deferred to architect-notes)

### Past sprint — S001-codex-extraction (2026-05-27, CLOSED)
- [x] Phase A — open Lattice 3.0 session + architect plan
- [x] B1 pre-extraction prep (A3 import verification + .gitignore extension; pyproject.toml deferred to MI-13)

- [x] B8 project-codex archive disposition (cross-repo `53b4fa9`)
- [x] B9 Auditor dispatch — verdict `pass` with 3 observations (F-1 fixed inline; F-2 → MI-13; F-3 implicit Step 4)
